The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **S&P 500 Data Project**. The project aims to get data on all stocks in the S&P500 index by using the Alpha Vantage API. Following this, we choose some big-tech company stocks and present their prices in an interactive figure. Lastly, we identify stocks exhibiting short-term momentum.

# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Discrete call-option pricing model** and the goal of this project is to formulate a script that correctly prices discrete call options. The main extension to the model is to analyze how an investor could combine the asset and the risk-free asset to replicate the option.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** This project uses Numpy, Sympy and Matplotlib, which can be installed from the terminal by using pip install.

# Exam project

Our project is titled **Exam project** and the goal of this project is to perform a linear regression, consider a microeconomic problem with durable durable purchases and lastly implement an algorithm to make the given code run correctly.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [examproject.ipynb](examproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** This project uses Numpy, Sympy, SciPy, Axes3D and Matplotlib, which can be installed from the terminal by using pip install.
