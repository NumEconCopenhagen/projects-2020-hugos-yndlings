# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Discrete call-option pricing model** and the goal of this project is to formulate a script that correctly prices discrete call options. The main extension to the model is to analyze how an investor could combine the asset and the risk-free asset to replicate the option.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** This project uses Numpy, Sympy and Matplotlib, which can be installed from the terminal by using pip install.
