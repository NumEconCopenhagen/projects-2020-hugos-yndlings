# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **S&P 500 Data Project**. The project aims to get data on all stocks in the S&P500 index by using the Alpha Vantage API. Following this, we choose some big-tech company stocks and present their prices in an interactive figure. Lastly, we identify stocks exhibiting short-term momentum.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install plotly==4.5.4``
